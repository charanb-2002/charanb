The Founding Titan by screaming, could turn Subjects of Ymir into Titans, control the minds of Titans, and alter the memories and bodies of Subjects of Ymir, but only if the inheritor had royal blood or was in contact with a Titan of royal blood. It was connected to all Subjects of Ymir and Titans via paths.
